# SAEGIS COMPUTER SCIENCE Exercise

This is a repository for sharing sample code for troubleshooting software bugs.

## How to compile

### Requirements

You will need,

<ul>
<li>Java 8</li>
<li>Maven</li>
<li>Your favourite IDE like, IntelliJ or Netbeans</li>
</ul>

### How to run

You can locate the output jar file in the target directory. To execute,

<ul>
<li>Take a terminal window</li>
<li>Change directory in to where the JAR file is located</li>
<li>Execute : java -jar MyLuckyNumber-1.0-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar </li>
<li>Type your birthday for example : 05-12-2002 </li>
<li>Your lucky number should be displayed </li>
</ul>

### Logic

The lucky number is supposed to be calculated as explained below.

If your birthdate is : 05-12-2002 Your lucky number is = 0 + 5 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 2

This program has few problems (bugs!).

Initially this program may not run. you have to correct them one by one.

Happy Coding.........
